''' Find the high and low index o(log(n)

Low index
Letâ€™s look at the algorithm for finding the low index:

At every step, consider the array between low and high indices and calculate the mid index.
If the element at mid index is less than the key, low becomes mid + 1 (to move towards the start of range).
If the element at mid is greater or equal to the key, the high becomes mid - 1. Index at low remains the same.
When low is greater than high, low would be pointing to the first occurrence of the key.
If the element at low does not match the key, return -1.

High index
Similarly, we can find the high index by slightly modifying the above condition:

Switch the low index to mid + 1 when the element at mid index is less than or equal to the key.
Switch the high index to mid - 1 when the element at mid is greater than the key.
